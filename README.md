Have you always wanted to buff minecarts to make them more useful and transport you between your or your friends' bases ? This mod adds new rails : copper rails and rail crossings.

## Copper Rails

Copper rails are more powerful rails than regular golden powered rails. However their speed reduces with oxidation ! You can also use this reduced speed (slower than regular powered rails when fully oxidized) to brake carts or move them slowly.

- Normal (unoxidized) copper rails are twice as fast as vanilla powered rails, making them slightly faster than the fastest horse you can theoretically get.
- Copper rails can be waxed the same ways (apply or craft) than vanilla oxidizable blocks.

## Rail Crossing
Minecraft lets you turn rails of a 3-way intersection with redstone, but it is unfortunately impossible with 4-way intersections (crossings). This is fixed with this mod, introducing the rail crossing block ! On the crossing, minecarts can only go forward, but the direction of the rail can be switched with redstone.

- Choose the default orientation when placing. Power the crossing via its top or bottom (all edges should be occupied by rails). If the crossing turns its default position because you placed adjacent rails next to it, just replace it.
- Crossings can not have an ascending shape (still achievable with debug stick but behaviours are not supported).

## 3D Rails

A built-in resource pack is included in the mod to render 3D rails like VanillaTweaks 3D rails.

## Other minor changes
- Max speed on rails (non powered rails) is now the speed of normal copper rails (instead of vanilla powered rails speed).
- Max speed is capped to lower speed when ascending.
